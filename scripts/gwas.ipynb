        "Violations of Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium can indicate either the presence of population substructure, or the occurence of genotyping error. It is common practice to assume that violoations are indicative of genotyping error and remove SNPs in which the HWE test statistic has a corresponding p-value of less then 1x10-6. A threshold of `r snakemake@params[[\"HWE\"]]` is used here.\n",

        "\n",
        "Samples with discordance between self-reported and genetically predicted sex likely have errors in sample handling, such as sample swaps. Predicted sex can be determined by calculating X chromosome heterozygosity using an F test, because biological men have one X chromosome and women have two. An F value of ~0.99 indicates males, and an F value of ~0.03 indicates females. Furthermore, checking X chromosome heterozygosity may reveal sex chromosome anomalies (~0.28 in reported females; ~0.35 in males).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Population based cohorts are often limited to unrelated individuals as associations statistics often assume independence across individuals. Closely related samples will share more of their genome and are likely to be more phenotypically similar than than two individuals chosen randomly from the population. A common measure of relatedness is identity by descent (IBD), where a kinship correlation coefficient (pi-hat) greater 0.1 suggests that samples maybe related or duplicates samples.\n",
