# Schedule {.unnumbered}
Welcome to this BMI Mini-Course on an Methods in Genetic Epidemiology. The course structure is divided into three key methodologies: genome-wide association studies, polygenic risk scores, and Mendelian randomization. Each trainee will apply these methods to a trait of their choosing and, at the course's conclusion, present their findings to the class.

## Week 1 04/22 - 04/26

## Week 2 04/29 - 05/03
### Monday 04/29
**Heritability & Genetic Correlations** 

Heritability quantifies the proportion of phenotype variance attributable to genetic factors, whereas genetic correlations assess the extent of shared genetic architecture between traits. In this session, we will concentrate on the tools utilized to estimate these metrics from GWAS summary statistics.
